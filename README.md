# odin-recipes

This is my first project in The Odin Project (TOP).

Under foundation level in TOP, I learned some basic HTML and CSS markup language tags. I also learned how to set up git and github. This project uses all the skills that I have learned so far in creating a basic website called odin-recipes.
